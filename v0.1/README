Atropa belladonna was once used to induce midriasis in a woman's pupils, making them appear more beautiful with such dilation in response to the atropine alkaloid, typically found in its berries. 
Abstractly, the Belladonna project is meant to be a straightforward Python 3 module to organize and structure data in any GNU/Linux environment;
This aims to make its contents easily navigable and user-friendly, as if an "extra light entering the user's pupils," similar to how the poisonous Atropa belladonna berries were once used to affect human eyes.
